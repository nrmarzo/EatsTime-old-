# Eats Time
Eat's Time
- a food delivery website

What is the nature of the project?

Eat's Time is a project that aims to be used as an alternative way to order food. Rather than ordering directly from a restaurantâ€™s delivery system, Eat's Time can give an array of restaurant options. This gives users an easier way of finding different restaurants without scouring a multitude of restaurant sites. 


What are the uses of the system?

The system will be used in two ways. First, the user will be able to find different restaurant options throughout the city of Winnipeg. Second, the system will be able to order from one or multiple restaurants and have it delivered directly to the user.


Who will use the system?

Eat's Time will mainly be used by students, single people, young workers, small companies, and generally people looking to order food.


What is the expected use of the system?

The expected use of the system will be for when someone decides to order takeout. This could be a decision driven by laziness, lack of groceries, and/or unwillingness to step outside. Instead of going to a specific restaurant website, the users can find multiple restaurant options within the same site.
